                <li class="mb-2">Stand with your feet hip-width apart, ensuring your weight is evenly distributed across both feet. Let your arms relax naturally at your sides.</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Take a deep breath in, filling your lungs completely. As you exhale, engage your core muscles and begin to bend forward from your hips, keeping your spine long and straight.</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Maintain a slight bend in your knees to avoid locking them. Reach your hands down towards the floor or your toes, extending as far as is comfortable without straining.</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Allow your head and neck to relax fully, hanging freely towards the ground. Avoid tensing your shoulders or upper back.</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Hold this forward bend position for several deep breaths, feeling a stretch in your hamstrings and lower back. To return to standing, engage your core and slowly roll up vertebra by vertebra, lifting your head last.</li>
